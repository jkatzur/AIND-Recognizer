    DIC = log(P(X(i)) - 1/(M-1)SUM(log(P(X(all but i))


    The philosophical idea of DIC is that we should look at how much more likely a model is to
    correctly identify a particular word than other words in the vocabulary. Essentially it looks at
    the incremental likelihood of the model correctly identifying the right word over the average scores
    for other words in the vocab.

    To calculate this we use two terms ->
        1) The Log Likelihood of the word being picked, and
        2) Average Log Likelihood of every other word in the vocab using the model

    We then take the difference of terms to calculate the incremental
